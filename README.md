# DPDPA Engineering Kit

Tested code for India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and the DPDP Rules, 2025:
consent records, breach detection, encryption, data residency, CI/CD privacy gates and
control mappings. Each folder comes from one of
[StateCheck Security's articles](https://statechecksecurity.com/blog), which explain the
obligation behind the code.

> **Not legal advice.** This kit shows engineering patterns. Whether a pattern meets an
> obligation depends on your processing, your contracts and how the Data Protection Board
> reads the Rules. Have your counsel or DPO review your implementation.

## How it is tested

Everything in the kit runs in CI on every push ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)):

| What | How |
|---|---|
| Python | `ruff check`, `pytest`, including FastAPI endpoints through `TestClient` and AWS calls through botocore's `Stubber` |
| SQL | Each schema loaded into a fresh PostgreSQL 16 database, then a behaviour test (constraints, partitions, append-only triggers, role grants) |
| Rego | `opa fmt`, `opa check --strict`, `opa test` (OPA 1.10, Rego v1) |
| Terraform | `fmt -check`, `validate`, and `terraform test` against mocked providers, so no cloud account is needed |
| AWS IAM | Every condition key checked against AWS's [Service Reference](https://servicereference.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) |
| nginx | The TLS config is loaded into nginx and probed: TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2 AEAD accepted, CBC suites and TLS 1.1 refused |
| Semgrep | `semgrep --validate` and `semgrep --test` against an annotated fixture |
| Workflows, Istio, diagrams | `actionlint`, `istioctl validate`, Mermaid CLI render |
| Shell steps | The workflow's own grep steps are run against fixture repositories |

Not tested: the Splunk search runs only on Splunk, so its `.conf` structure is checked but
not its results. The GitLab pipeline is checked for structure and its shell step is run, but
GitLab's own linter needs a GitLab instance.

### Run it locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
ruff check .
pytest                       # add -m "not docker and not network" to skip those tests
```

The SQL, OPA, Terraform and Semgrep checks need those tools (or Docker); the CI workflow shows
the exact commands. `scripts/sql-tests.sh` runs the SQL suites against any PostgreSQL you
point the `PG*` variables at.

## Using the code

Copy what you need. Each folder's README says what to replace (keys, role ARNs, bucket names,
your data inventory) before the code is safe to run against real data. The Python modules
keep their collaborators (stores, KMS clients, queues) behind small interfaces with in-memory
versions for tests, so you can plug in your own.
